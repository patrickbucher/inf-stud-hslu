		<h2>Project task definition</h2>
		<p>
			The idea of each project is to apply the visualization principles, you have learned in the course. You
			choose the data and task for your project yourself. Your job is to develop a meaningful interactive
			visualization solving the task defined by you in D3.js. You may of course use Tableau Prep or Tableau
			for data preparation. You will hand in a complete web site with task &amp; data description, concept
			sketch, interactive visualization, references and authors.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Problem Definition
		</h2>
		<p>
			The problem definition (a.k.a research question) is the cornerstone of your visualization project. It
			should be clear and focused, as well as of personal interest to you. You should develop your problem
			definition in order to target the specific topic but remember that the visualization should also be able
			to answer that question. Spend some time collecting information about a topic that interests you and
			remember to mention the most relevant references in the link section of your website. Discuss possible
			research questions with your group member and choose one for your project proposal.
            <a href="assets/html/research.html">→ Research</a>
		</p>
		<h2>
			Data
		</h2>
		<p>
			As a group, you should choose the data best fitting your research question. There is no restriction on
			the data you should use but remember that the source should be reliable. There are many open datasets
			available in the Internet. Please make sure that there is no copyright problem, i.e. you are allowed to
			use the data, as this could lead to legal issues. Once you selected the data, keep track of basic metadata
			information, as you should present it in your project proposal and in a dedicated section of your
			website.
            <a href="assets/html/data.html">→ Data</a>
		</p>
		<h2>
			Visualization
		</h2>
		<p>
			One (or more) interactive visualizations should be the core practical outcome of your project. This is
			the main support that visitors of your website should use to investigate and understand your data and
			problem. Spend some time on the Internet looking at existing solutions and draft a paper sketch
			(Figure 1 and 2). We ask you to enclose a sketch like this with the project proposal and on your final
			webpage. Remember that you should be able to justify the design solutions you implement. You need
			to be able to discuss the motivation, justification of your design solutions when presenting your
			research project in oral form.

		<h2>
			Your Web-Artifact
		</h2>
		<p>
			As previously mentioned, your visualization project goes beyond a simple visualization. We expect
			you to provide a complete web-based solution on your research topic. Ideally you should include at
			least the following elements:
			<ul>
				<li>
					A home page that allows navigating within the pages of your website
                    <a href="index.html">→ Home</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					A section with background information on your research project and your first sketch
                    <a href="assets/html/research.html">→ Research</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					A section providing basic information on your data sources
                    <a href="assets/html/data.html">→ Data</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					A section with your visualization(s) (including interactive elements such as filtering)
                    <a href="assets/html/visualization.html">→ Visualization</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					A section with respect to your visual design choices (2500 to 3500 letters inclusive white spaces).
                    <a href="assets/html/description.html">→ Description</a>
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Foundations Visual Design
					</li>
					<li>
						Fundamental Principles of Analytical Design (Tufte)
					</li>
					<li>
						Data-Ink Ratio (Tufte)
					</li>
					<li>
						Human Perception
					</li>
					<li>
						Tasks in Data Visualization
					</li>
					<li>
						Interaction Concept
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>
					A section with references to relevant information on your research topic together with findings
                    <a href="assets/html/references.html">→ References</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					A contact section with some information about the group members
                    <a href="assets/html/about.html">→ About</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
