A general approach to the topic of measuring air quality with IoT devices is described in \cite{air_quality}. The article provides an overview of the most important gases determining air quality.  Nicol and Humphreys investigate the notion of \textit{Thermal Comfort}, which is a combination of objective and subjective factors in the perception of room climate \cite{nicol2002adaptive}. Epstein and Daniel investigate on the relationship between thermal stress and the translation of the stress in terms of physiological and psychological strain \cite{epstein2006thermal}.

The effect of CO₂ concentration was investigated in \cite{indoor_pollutant}. It can be shown that concentrations exceeding the level of 1000ppm increasingly start to have a negative impact on people's concentration. More information on CO₂ in general and its negative effect on well-being and efficiency can be found online as well\footnote{ \url{https://www.businessinsider.com/office-air-co2-levels-making-workers-tired-2017-11?r=US&IR=T}\\
