# Summary

Plastic is cheap and disposed of quickly after use. How plastic is disposed
depends on the consumer’s responsibility and residence. In many countries
garbage is stocked in landfills, polluting air and groundwater. In other
countries, garbage is burnt in incinerators, emitting huge amounts of CO2. If
plastic enters a water current, it likely ends up in the ocean, where it slowly
decomposes and is eaten by fish and other marine creatures. Health detrimental
residues of plastic end up on our dining plate, because edible fish such as
salmon and tuna eat smaller fish contaminated by plastic particles. Some kinds
of plastic can be recycled, others should be avoided. [108 words]
