\section*{Abstract}

OAuth 2 is a delegation protocol that lives within the context of HTTP. It is mainly used to connect websites to one another and to secure APIs exposed to the web. OAuth 2 enables resource owners to delegate (limited) access to clients without sharing their credentials. OAuth 2 is neither an authentication nor an authorization protocol, but it defines the mechanisms to build such protocols. It does not define any cryptographic mechanisms, but leaves those decisions open for the implementation. The authorization server plays a key role in every web application that is secured through the means of OAuth 2. This paper gives an overview of the components and mechanisms involved in an OAuth 2 secured web application. Furthermore, a demo OAuth 2 application is presented as a case study to elucidate the role of and communication between different components involved in an OAuth 2 deployment. The JWT token format and common vulnerabilities of OAuth 2 are the subject of additional chapters.
