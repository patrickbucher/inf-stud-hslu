# Summary

## Becoming the Boss

In her article _Becoming the Boss_ (Hill, 2018), the author describes the
struggles first-time managers face. Succeeding as a manager requires a
different skill set than succeeding as a individual. New managers first need to
understand the nature of their new role, which usually happens in a "learning
by doing" or even "try and fail" process. New managers are often thrown into
their first management position without support from their superiours -- even
though they used to be former first-time managers, too, and know the struggles
a first-time manager is facing.

Authority does not come with the position, but must be earned. Especially
talented subordinates do not just follow orders blindly, but question their new
boss and scrutinize him for hidden motives. A manager focusing on technical
problems could become a micromanager and a "control freak". Showing off
technical skills can even undermine a manager's credibility. The manager's role
is not about solving technical problems, but about managing interdependencies.

Managing a team is not the same as managing a bunch of individuals: Every
decision concerning a team member affects the team as a whole. Granting
privileges on a single team member can have a negative impact on the team as a
whole, for every other team member feels worse off without those privileges. A
manager should focus instead on shaping team culture, which can unleash the
team's problem-solving prowess.

A common misconception is that the boss is supposed to have all the answers.
New managers often tend to avoid questions, because they are afraid to look
"dumb" in front of their superiours or subordinates. Asking questions can help
to clarify open points, and ensures that both parties involved talk about the
same thing. Once clarity about an issue is established, nobody can try to sneak
out under the pretense that he or she understood it differently.  A new
manager's success is not only important for a single team, but for the
organization as a whole.

## The Eisenhower Matrix

- A manager needs to deal with urgent and important tasks on his own immediately.
- Tasks that are neither urgent nor important he must discard.
- Important tasks without urgency tend to become urgent as time goes, and
  therefore require a plan for dealing with them.
- Unimportant but urgent tasks must be delegated to an appropriate subordinate.

Succesful managers can handle the tasks of the _task list_ and _delegate_
quadrant accordingly. (Schaub, 2019).

    +         urgency        -
      |----------|-----------|
    i |          |           |
    m |          |           |
    p |  me now  | task list |
    o |          |           |
    r |          |           |
    t |----------|-----------|
    a |          |           |
    n |          |           |
    c | delegate |   trash   |
    e |          |           |
      |          |           |
    - |----------|-----------|

## The Pyramids

An organisation can be seen as a pyramid, in which the hierarchy levels (C-level
executives, middle management and employees) are separated by horizontal
borders, or _hierarchical barriers_, because one not simply moves from one
layer to the next one. Lines from the pyramid's tip to its base form the
functional borders between departments (HR, Finance, Engineering, etc.), or
_functional barriers_, if those departments not interoperate smoothly
(_isolated islands_). The hierarchical and functional barriers combined result
in a organisation with inhibited exchange both horizontally and vertically,
which are referred to as _isolated knowledge islands_. (Schaub, 2019)

## The Three Ways

Three fundamental approaches for earning respect and authority from
subordinates can be distinguished as follows:

1. _Being the Boss_: Command, Control, Correct
    - The most experienced subordinates will perform worse, slow down and
      develop a tendency to find obstacles everywhere.
    - Some subordinates will just deliver the utmost necessary.
    - And some will sacrifice quality for fast results.
2. _Being a Friend_
    - A friend is not person of authority, but a peer.
    - Friends might take advantage of their position, which could lead to
      inbalances within the team.
3. _Hard Workd & Earn Trust_
    - By showing to your team that you work hard, you put yourself in their
      shoes and on their level.
    - Your team sees that you do not just delegate, but also understand what is
      going on, and therefore will trust you more.

# Questions & Answers

1. How can you tell when you are facing ordinary adjustment problems and when
   it is your actual wrong-doing?
    - Because everybody makes errors, they are a bad measurement for wrong-doing.
    - One must take decisions, avoiding them is worse than making errors.
    - Tracking parameters and improving on those is a good strategy.
2. Aren't these adjustment problems a neccessity to prepare you as a manager
   for worse situations?
    - Only a few companies help first-time managers early on; and starting the
      process too early might actually be contraproductive, for a manager must
      be able to figure out things on his own.
    - However, the knowledge about the "traumatic" first years is not widely
      spread.
3. What are some of these problems that almost always occur when transitioning
   to a first manager position?
    - It is hard to step out of one's engineering role and mindset.
    - Building trust in subordinates is hard, especially if you can perform
      some jobs better than them at the beginning.
    - Developing management skills (planning, negotiating, leading) takes time
      and effort.
4. Will becoming a manager stay equally hard when many companies are
   transitioning from hierarchical to more flat organizations themselves?
    - Organizations are always measured by their success, and so are managers,
      no matter how the organization is structured.
    - Changing into a management position, be it a team leader in an
      hierarchical organization, or a _Product Owner_ or _Scrum Master_ in an
      agile start-up, is always difficult and requires a new set of skills.
5. Aren't there also situations where neglecting all forms of authority in
   order to build better relationships with subordinates become a problem in
   itself?
    - Leading a former friend is difficult. A friend is on the same level, not so a boss.
    - Mutual respect is needed.
